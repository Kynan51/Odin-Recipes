            <li>
                Boil water until it bubbles. The water should be very hot. This ensures the ugali will cook perfectly</li>
    
            <li>
                Add a cup full of flour into the water. Let it cook a few seconds until water starts to cover the flour</li>
            
            <li>
                Use a wooden spoon to quickly start mixing the flour and water</li>
            
            <li>
                Add a handful of flour and continue to mix the water and flour it will start to come together</li>
            
            <li>
                Reduce heat to medium and keep turning the ugali as it continues to stick together</li>
            
            <li>
                Gather the ugali and press it onto the side of the sufuria</li>
            
            <li>
                place the wooden slioon under the ugali and form into a ball in the middle of the sufuria</li>
            
            <li>
                Repeat pressing the ugali on the side of the sufuria and turning it to the middle</li>
            
            <li>
                Once the ugali has become firm, turn it once more and smoothen it into a round. You will know your ugali is ready once you start to smell the aroma clearly</li>

                Turn the ugali over onto a plate</li>

                Dip the wooden spoon into water and use it to smoothen the ugali into a round ball on the plate</li>
            
            
            <li>
